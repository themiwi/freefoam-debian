System requirements
-------------------
{project} is developed and tested on Linux, but should work with other Unix
style systems, notably Mac OS X (C). The support for Microsoft Windows is a
goal, which, however, is still far off.

Required software to build {project}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[[cmake]]CMake::
  In order to build {project} you need to have CMake with version 2.8.2 or
  newer installed. In order to follow the link:INSTALL.html[INSTALL]
  instructions, make sure that you also install the package contain the curses
  GUI ccmake if using a package manager (e.g. on Linux systems. For Debian
  and Ubuntu the package is called _cmake-curses-gui_). {cmake}
[[build_system]]Build system::
  CMake requires a native build system. On Unix-like platforms GNU Make is
  recommended. {make}
[[cxx_compiler]]{cpp} compiler::
  In order to build {project} you need a {cpp} compiler with good support for
  template expressions. The g++ compiler from GCC-4.3 and above will do
  fine. {gcc}
[[flex]]flex::
  The flex lexer generator. Version 2.5.33 is known to work. For more recent
  versions there have been reports of problems. {flex}
[[zlib]]zlib::
  zlib compression library. {zlib}
[[scotch]]SCOTCH::
  The SCOTCH graph partitioning library. Version 5.1.7 is know to work.
  {scotch}
[[python]]Python::
  The Python interpreter. Version 2.6 is known to work, but care has been taken
  to make {project} work with versions from 2.4 on, including 3.x.
+
[NOTE]
In order to build the man pages or the user guide, AsciiDoc is required
which has not yet been ported to Python 3. This is why Python version 2 is also
required (only at build-time for the documentation) if a Python 3 interpreter
is used.

Optional software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[[git]]git::
  To check out a current development version of {project}, git is required.
  {git}
[[parlib]]Parallel Communications Library::
  In order to run {project} in parallel, a communications library is required.
  Currently the only available options is MPI (_Message Passing Interface_).
  There are many implementations of the MPI standard. The one that has been
  tested and is known to work with {project} is {openmpi}.
[[metis]]METIS::
  The METIS graph partitioning library, version 5.0.1. If your package
  manager doesn't contain it, you can also have {project} build it
  automatically for you (see the <<installation,installation section>>).
  {metis}
[[parmetis]]ParMetis::
  If you use an MPI library, the ParMetis library is required. If your package
  manager doesn't contain this library, {project} can build it automatically
  for you (refer to the <<installation,installation notes>> below). {parmetis}
[[mgridgen]]MGRIDGEN:: MGRIDGEN is a grid coarsening library for multi-grid
  solvers. {project} can build this automatically for you. Please refer to the
  link:INSTALL.html#enable-parmgridgen[INSTALL] file for license restrictions.
  {mgridgen}
[[libccmio]]libccmio::
  pro-STAR (C) input/output library. {project} can build this automatically for
  you. Please refer to the link:INSTALL.html#enable-ccmio[INSTALL] file for
  license restrictions. {ccmio}
[[paraview]]ParaView::
  The {project} utility 'para' requires this visualization application, version
  3.8 or later. {paraview}
[[m4]]M4::
  Some of the provided tutorial cases require the M4 macro processor. {m4}
[[doxygen]]Doxygen::
  Automatic API-documentation generator. Required to build the source
  documentation. {doxygen}
[[asciidoc]]AsciiDoc::
  In order to create the man-pages or the XHTML and PDF documentation you need
  to have a fully working AsciiDoc toolchain installed. Versions newer than 8.5
  are known to work. AsciiDoc itself needs Python 2.4 or newer (but not 3.x),
  xsltproc, the DocBook XML DTD's and the DocBook XSL stylesheets. Refer to the
  AsciiDoc installation instructions for the details. Also note, that AsciiDoc
  versions 8.6.5 and 8.6.6 contain a bug which makes it depend on Python 2.5
  and newer. {asciidoc}
[[dblatex]]dblatex::
  If you want to build the PDF version of the user guide, it is recommended
  that you have dblatex installed, as the generated output is superior to that
  generated with the alternative, Apache FOP. {dblatex}
[[fop]]Apache FOP::
  If you want to build the PDF version of the user guide but can't or don't
  want to install <<dblatex>>, Apache FOP can be used instead. It's output,
  however, is inferior to that of dblatex, especially that of the formulas.
  {fop}
[[mathjax]]MathJax::
  If you enable MathJax for math-rendering in the XHTML version of the user
  guide, but don't want to use the shared installation over the network, you
  can install MathJax locally. {mathjax}

[[installation]]
Installation
------------
For exhaustive installation and basic usage instructions, refer to the
link:INSTALL.html[INSTALL] file.

Documentation
-------------
All the applications and the frequently used script utilities come with a brief
man-page. Unfortunately, most of them are little more than stubs and need more
work. The man-page _freefoam(1)_ gives a short overview over all applications
and utilities and documents the {project} configuration options.

API-documentation is available from {apidoc}.

Further, most {project} applications and utilities support the '-doc' and
'-srcDoc' options, which will automatically display the API-documentation and
the source code of the application, respectively.
