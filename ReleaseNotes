FreeFOAM is a cross-platform toolkit for computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
based on http://openfoam.org[OpenFOAM(R)]. It is geared towards "freeing"
OpenFOAM from its system dependence, enabling it to run natively on a variety
of operating systems. Currently it still requires a Unix-like environment.
FreeFOAM has been tested to build (and partially to run) on

* http://www.ubuntu.com[Ubuntu] 12.04

FreeFOAM uses the excellent cross-platform build system
http://cmake.org[CMake] thanks to which FreeFOAM can now be installed just like
any other software and doesn't depend on a slew of shell init scripts and a
huge number of environment variables to build and run, making live easier for
system administrators and users alike.

Refer to the enclosed link:INSTALL.html[INSTALL] file for installation and
usage instructions.

This is a bug-fix release of the FreeFOAM 0.1 series. For an overview of the
changes and new features added to FreeFOAM, consult the
link:ChangeLog.html[ChangeLog] file. For the detailed list of changes, refer to
the log provided by the
http://repo.or.cz/w/freefoam.git[FreeFOAM GIT repository].

If you have questions or think you found a bug, please subscribe and post to
the http://freefoam.sourceforge.net/support.html[FreeFOAM-users mailing list].

This release builds upon revision linkrepo:openfoam17[d08d3c] (2011-07-14) of
the official OpenCFD(R) patch releases repository for OpenFOAM 1.7.x.
