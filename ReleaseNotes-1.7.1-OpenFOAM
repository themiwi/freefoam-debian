* Overview
  OpenFOAM-1.7.1 is the latest release of OpenFOAM derived from OpenFOAM-1.7.0
  including a number of bug-fixes and new developments.  This release passes our
  standard tests and the tutorials have been broadly checked.  Please report any
  bugs by following the link: http://www.openfoam.com/bugs.

* GNU/Linux version
  This release of OpenFOAM is distributed primarily in 2 ways: (1) as a Debian
  pack containing binaries and source; (2) from the SourceForge source code
  repository (see [[./README.org][README]]).

  The Ubuntu/Debian pack is available for 32 and 64 bit versions of the 10.04
  LTS operating system using the system compiler and libraries that will be
  installed automatically from standard Debian packs.

  To use the source version from the SourceForge repository, we provide a source
  pack of third-party packages that can be compiled on the user's system.  This
  does not include =gcc=, since the system installed version is typically
  sufficient, but includes =paraview-3.8.0=, =openmpi-1.4.1=, =scotch_5.1=,
  =metis-5.0pre2=, =ParMetis-3.1= and =ParMGridGen-1.0=.

* Compiler Support
  OpenFOAM-1.7.1 now compiles and optimises correctly using gcc-4.5.0 following
  the resolution of memory aliasing issues.

* Operating System Support
  OpenFOAM-1.7.1 has been verified to run on OpenSuSE-11.3 using the system
  gcc-4.5.0 compiler.

* Developments and Bug-fixes
