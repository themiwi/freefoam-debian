Package: libfreefoam
Section: libs
Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: libraries for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
 Libraries and modules for grid generation, simulation and analyzing
 of complex fluid flows. The flows may involve chemical reactions,
 turbulence, heat transfer, solid dynamics, electromagnetics and even
 the pricing of financial options. The libraries also include
 algorithms for post-processing and visualizing the resulting
 data. FreeFOAM is a fork of OpenFOAM.

Package: libfreefoam-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, libfreefoam (= ${binary:Version}), ${python:Depends}
Description: libraries for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) - development files
 Libraries and modules for grid generation, simulation and analyzing of
 complex fluid flows, post-processing and visualizing of the resulting
 data. The flows may involve chemical reactions, turbulence, heat
 transfer, solid dynamics, electromagnetics and even the pricing of
 financial options. FreeFOAM is a fork of OpenFOAM.
