== {project} cases

This chapter deals with the file structure and organisation of {project} cases.
Normally, a user would assign a name to a case, 'e.g.' the tutorial case of
flow in a cavity is simply named `cavity`. This name becomes the name of a
directory in which all the case files and subdirectories are stored. The case
directories themselves can be located anywhere.

The tutorial cases that accompany the {project} distribution provide useful
examples of the case directory structures. The tutorials are located in the
filename:<tutorials>[] directory. Users can view tutorial examples at their
leisure while reading this chapter.
