== Mesh generation and conversion

This chapter describes all topics relating to the creation of meshes in
{project}: <<sec_blockMeshDict>> gives an overview of the ways a mesh may be
described in {project}; <<sec_blockMeshGenerator>> covers the `blockMesh`
utility for generating simple meshes of blocks of hexahedral cells;
<<sec_snappyHexMeshGenerator>> covers the `snappyHexMesh` utility for
generating complex meshes of hexahedral and split-hexahedral cells
automatically from triangulated surface geometries; <<sec_meshConversion>>
describes the options available for conversion of a mesh that has been
generated by a third-party product into a format that {project} can read.
