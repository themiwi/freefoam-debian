== Models and physical properties

{project} includes a large range of solvers each designed for a specific class
of problem. The equations and algorithms differ from one solver to another so
that the selection of a solver involves the user making some initial choices on
the modelling for their particular case. The choice of solver typically
involves scanning through their descriptions in <<tab_standardSolvers>> to find
the one suitable for the case. It ultimately determines many of the parameters
and physical properties required to define the case but leaves the user with
some modelling options that can be specified at runtime through the entries in
dictionary files in the filename:constant[](((filename:constant[] directory)))
(((directory,filename:constant[]))) directory of a case. This chapter deals
with many of the more common models and associated properties that may be
specified at runtime.
