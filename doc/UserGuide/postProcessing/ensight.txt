=== Post-processing with 'EnSight'

{project} offers the capability for post-processing {project} cases with
'EnSight' by converting the {project} data to 'EnSight' format with the
`foamToEnsight` utility.

==== Converting data to 'EnSight' format

The `foamToEnsight` utility converts data from {project} to 'EnSight' file
format. For a given case, `foamToEnsight` is executed like any normal
application. `foamToEnsight` creates a directory named filename:Ensight[] in
the case directory, 'deleting any existing dirname:Ensight[] directory in the
process'. The converter reads the data in all time directories and writes into
a case file and a set of data files. The case file is named
filename:EnSight_Case[] and contains details of the data file names. Each data
file has a name of the form filename:EnSight_<nn>.<ext>[], where `<nn>` is an
incremental counter starting from 1 for the first time directory, 2 for the
second and so on and `<ext>` is a file extension of the name of the field that
the data refers to, as described in the case file, 'e.g.' `T` for temperature,
`mesh` for the mesh. Once converted, the data can be read into 'EnSight' by the
normal means:

. from the 'EnSight' GUI, the user should select
  menuselection:[File --> Data (Reader)];
. the appropriate filename:EnSight_Case[] file should be highlighted in the
  guilabel:[Files] box;
. the guilabel:[Format] selector should be set to guilabel:[Case], the
  'EnSight' default setting;
. the user should click guibutton:[(Set) Case] and guibutton:[Okay].
