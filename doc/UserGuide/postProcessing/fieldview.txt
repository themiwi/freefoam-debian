=== Post-processing with 'Fieldview'

{project} offers the capability for post-processing {project} cases with
'Fieldview'. The method involves running a post-processing utility
`foamToFieldview` to convert case data from {project} to 'Fieldview'
filename:.uns[] file format. For a given case, `foamToFieldview` is executed
like any normal application. `foamToFieldview` creates a directory named
dirname:Fieldview[] in the case directory, 'deleting any existing'
dirname:Fieldview[] 'directory in the process'. By default the converter reads
the data in all time directories and writes into a set of files of the form
filename:<case>_<nn>.uns[], where '<nn>' is an incremental counter starting
from 1 for the first time directory, 2 for the second and so on. The user may
specify the conversion of a single time directory with the option
`-time <time>`, where '<time>' is a time in general, scientific or fixed
format.

'Fieldview' provides certain functions that require information about boundary
conditions, 'e.g.' drawing streamlines that uses information about wall
boundaries. The converter tries, wherever possible, to include this information
in the converted files by default. The user can disable the inclusion of this
information by using the option:-noWall[] option in the execution command.

The data files for 'Fieldview' have the filename:.uns[] extension as mentioned
already. If the original {project} case includes a dot `.', 'Fieldview' may
have problems interpreting a set of data files as a single case with multiple
time steps.
