NAME
----
@FOAM_EXE_PREFIX@log - Extracts xy files from Foam logs

SYNOPSIS
--------
*@LOWER_PROJECT_NAME@ log* [-n][-s] '<logFile>'
*@LOWER_PROJECT_NAME@ log* -l '<logFile>'
*@LOWER_PROJECT_NAME@ log* -h

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The default is to extract for all the '"Solved for"' variables the initial
residual, the final residual and the number of iterations. On top of this a
(user editable) database of standard non-solved for variables is used to
extract data like Courant number, execution time etc.

The *-l* option shows all the possible variables but does not extract them.

The program will generate and run an awk script which writes a set of files,
'logs/<var>_<subIter>', for every '<var>' specified, for every occurrence
inside a time step.

For variables that are '"Solved for"' the initial residual name will be
'<var>', the final residual will get name '<var>FinalRes'.

The files are a simple 'xy' format with the first column Time (default) and the
second the extracted values. Option *-n* creates single column files with the
extracted data only.

The query database is a simple text format with three entries per line,
separated with '/'. Column 1 is the name of the variable (cannot contain
spaces), column 2 is the extended regular expression (egrep) to select the line
and column 3 is the string (fgrep) to select the column inside the line. The
value taken will be the first (non-space)word after this column. The database
will either be '$HOME/.FreeFOAM/foamLog.db' or if not found
'@FOAM_DATA_DIR@/foamLog.db'.

Option *-s* suppresses the default information and only prints the extracted
variables.

OPTIONS
-------
'<logFile>'::
  A @PROJECT_NAME@ log file (i.e. the screen-output created by a @PROJECT_NAME@ solver)
*-n*::
  Create a single-column file containing the extracted data only
*-s*::
  Suppresses the default information and only displays the extracted variable
  names
*-l*::
  List all possible variables but do not extract them
*-h*::
  Display an option summary
